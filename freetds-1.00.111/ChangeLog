    tds: Avoid possible data stuck in the kernel

    TDS protocol is quite latency sensitive. As the protocol is about
    sending requests and waiting for reply having data pending make
    requests slower.
    Resetting and setting again CORK flag (Linux and *BSD systems)
    optimise latency collapsing packets (so reduce bandwidth) however
    if the queue is full this does not cause a flush immediately
    but when the queue will became available the kernel will find
    CORK set so it won't send the partial final request causing delay.
    Setting both NODELAY and CORK solve the issue.

    never freed, so when SSL_free() was called, OpenSSL saw that it still has
    an unfreed certificate and would not free the overall structure.

    Always use max size for TEXT/NTEXT/IMAGE

    The network type information for these types allows to specify a
    size. However the definition of the type does not came with a size.
    Former implementation does not allows this type to be output and
    seems to ignore that length and accept any data even if bigger
    (data has also another length field).
    Current implementations allows to have BLOBs as output but not
    using these types.
    All tests passes with these sizes specified so feels safe and at
    the same time does not violate the assertion on other types where
    the data size has to be maximum the column size.

    Added support for configurable openssl cipher list

    Added new option to freetds.conf for specifying the cipher list
    supplied to openssl. This is necessary for several reasons:
    1. organizations that need more control over the specifics of
      encrypted connections
    2. to overcome the occasional incompatibility (sometimes intermittent)
       between open source encryption libraries and Microsoft's
       implementations. For example, several users reported intermittent
       connection problems where roughly 0.5% of connection attempts would
       fail for some reason. Removing specific key exchange protocols
       provided relief in at least one case.
    3. The cipher list can be specified in more generic terms, e.g.
       "HIGH:!SSLv2:!aNULL:-DH" rather than having to list specific cipher
       configurations that are otherwise subject to becoming outdated as
       the encryption landscape changes.

    Fix TLS hostname validation using OpenSSL

    When attempting to make a connection to a SQL Server and providing
    a CA Cert file, FreeTDS was unable to validate a hostname.

    The function check_name_match in tls.c was checking the wrong
    value from check_wildcard.

    This fixes GitHub Issue #90

    Process batch statements without a select correctly

    If you send a batch of statements in a single call to the database, and
    these statements don't return rows, the dbresults function doesn't
    process the data correctly. It will loop over all data the first time it
    is called and return to the calling function that there are no more
    rows.

    Added a return on TDS_DONE_RESULT that stops processing data when a batch
    of statements doesn't contain a select.

    Fix string conversion in ODBC if string is really long

    During string conversion is needed to compute and return the size
    of all converted string even if is returned only partially.
    In the case the part of the unconverted string was very long
    this was considered like an error (SQL_ERROR) instead of a
    warning (SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO).

    Extends cs_dt_crack to support newer types

    This add a new cs_dt_crack_v2 ABI function (cs_dt_crack API is redirected
    to it using a preprocessor macro). This to make the extension of
    CS_DATEREC more safe (version of 1.0 could call cs_dt_crack with
    CS_BIGDATETIME_TYPE/CS_BIGTIME_TYPE without having these fields written
    which would possible cause memory corruption on version compiled with
    these fields missing).
    This make sqsh compile and work with newer date/time types.
